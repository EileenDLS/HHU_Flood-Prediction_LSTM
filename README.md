# Research and Application of Flood Forecasting of Small and Medium Rivers Based on LSTM

In order to improve the accuracy and generalization of the flood prediction model, a LSTM-based rainfall runoff prediction method is proposed to realize the prediction and analysis of the runoff state of small and medium rivers. 
Use LSTM neural network to train historical data to obtain neural network weight parameters. 
Determine the LSTM model architecture according to the characteristics of the data, train the model through the selected training set and adjust the parameters to improve the model accuracy. 
This simulation experiment verifies the feasibility of the proposed method, which is more effective than traditional flood forecasting models.
